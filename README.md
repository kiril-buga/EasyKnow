# EasyKnow

EasyKnow is an Android app designed to help users learn and remember terms/words and their meanings. Within the Notification Settings, users can customize the timing, select specific days, and choose the number of words they want to be quizzed on through notifications. The built-in algorithm intelligently tracks performance (ranking system) and prioritizes quizzing users on terms that are less familiar.
